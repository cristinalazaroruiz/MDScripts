# PROTEIN PREPARATION

Within MD Simulations, a very important step is the preparation of the protein 3D structure. We have to make sure that:

-There is not missing residues. To do so, you can use script residue_check.py to extract PDB sequence. Afterwards, you can compare this sequence with the one present in UniProt using a sequence alignment (with ClustalX for example)

-The structure have protons.
