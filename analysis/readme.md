# ANALYSIS OF MD SiMULATIONS

In this folder you can find scripts to simplify and automate the analysis of results from GROMACS MD simulations.

- *xpm2dat.py* > this script is based on **GROMACS WRAPPER**, a Python framework for GROMACS. It uses GROMACS WRAPPER functions and classes to convert GROMACS XPM files—commonly produced for matrices such as distance matrices generated with *gmx mdmat*—into plain DAT files for further analysis.
